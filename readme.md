# **COMPSCI 1MD3** (Introduction to Programming) Skill Demonstration

## Using Python to learn fundamental programming skills

For my COMPSCI 1MD3 course at McMaster, we were required to use Python to practice and develop our programming skills. I already knew a substantial amount of Python going in to this course, so it was mainly review, however the work done in this course may still serve as a showcase for my capability using this language and was effective at refining my skills and capability using Python (and languages generally).

I have included samples of code done on my course assignments that I feel are the best indicators of my learning and skills.
