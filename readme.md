# **COMPSCI 1MD3** (Introduction to Programming) Skill Demonstration

## Using Python to learn fundamental programming skills

For my COMPSCI 1MD3 course at McMaster, we were required to use Python to practice and develop our programming skills. I already knew a substantial amount of Python going in to this course, so it was mainly review, however the work done in this course may still serve as a showcase for my capability using this language.

I have included assignments 3-10 (as .ipynb files), as well as a highlights document outlining some of the best code I have written in this course. Note that I have sanitized the assignment documents to remove any grading or extranious details from it. I did not recieve less than 100% on any assignment, including bonus marks. I did lose marks on a few edge cases I forgot to account for, or instances where I misunderstood the question but those were "silly errors," even if I learned something from each mistake I made.

I did not include Assignments 1 and 2 as they were heavily introductory. Assignments 8,9, and 10 may be better indicators of my capability with Python finishing this course, although the only concepts that were novel was file IO and sqlite3 (see learning highlights).
